        <p>LACING
            <br>
            The new Speed Lacing fastening system uses small bi-component part in lightweight steel and plastic. The fastening that extends towards the toe is divided into two sections. The lower part with eyelets allows the laces to pass through smoothly and adjust the fit in a single movement. The upper section has a lace lock that divides the fastening tension areas and hooks to progressively wrap the ankle securely.</p>

        <p>Nepal Cube, as the name suggests, is a new starting point for defining technical mountaineering boots thanks to the exceptional lightweight and thermal properties (a mere 950g per half pair). These features are achieved from the reduced weight of the sole/midsole using a Carbon Tech honeycomb, a thermal footbed and lightweight mini steel parts. The GORE-TEX Insulated Comfort lining contributes to the overall comfort of the boot, guaranteeing breathability and water resistance. EZ OUT technology for the tongue allows more precise regulation of the fit and encourages the elimination of sweat via a mesh fabric which draws humidity to the surface. The 3D Flex System provides comfort during walking and support for the ankle on steep terrain. The Vibram sole with Impact Brake System absorbs negative ground impact, while the graded lugs promote traction and keep feet in check on downhill terrain.
