    <P class="one">The history of women's shoes is a fascinating one, full of the kind of bizarre factoids that would interest even the most serious pub quizzer. Its one thats been shaped by the fashions of the time over the last 100 years, taking in various political movements along the way.</P>
    <br>
    <p class="two">The full story, however, stretches back much further than the 20th century. The history of women's footwear and the fashions and political movements that have dictated its changes, goes back hundreds, even thousands, of years.</p>
    
    <p class="three">Here we explore how, when and why women's shoe styles have changed over time and how those changes have affected, and have been affected by, the wider world.</p>

    <H2>A History of High Heels</H2>

    <p class="four">High heels have long been seen as a typically modern invention, however, the history of high heels is longer than you would think, with a fair few surprises. For example, high heels were not originally intended to be worn by women at all!</p>

    <P>High heels began back in ancient Greece, where actors wore platform shoes (at the time elevated with wood or cork) to represent social class, with the characters of a higher social standing wearing higher heels. Social class comedy was around even then!

        
        There are also traces found in ancient Egypt, where high-heeled shoes found by historians have been linked to religious ceremonies of the time. We’re not entirely sure of the purpose, but we can assume that the higher heels were supposed to lift the wearer closer to the gods.
        
        It wasn't until the 15th century that the notion of a high heel being 'feminine' began to take shape, with the first shoes of note being the hideous “Chopines”. These were first worn in Venice in the 1400s and were designed with dramatic platforms (often as high as 24 inches) in order to keep the 'real' shoes (which were, at the time, generally made from easily stained material such as satin) out of the mud that used to clog the streets.
        
        Platforms slowly developed into a cultural and decorative symbol that spread across Europe, until it reached England and France. There, the high heel was actually outlawed for a time, as it was the shoe favoured by prostitutes! Around this time (the mid-16th to 17th century), the high heel was also ridiculed by members of high society, religious commentators, and even the great William Shakespeare.</P>
